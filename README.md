# UML Changes :
We have added new subclasses for Vehicles .The three new subclasses of vehicles introduced are ElectricTrucks, Formula1Cars and RacingMotorcycles. Also new classes have been created to implement the Command Pattern.

# Assumptions : 

We are starting the simulation considering that there are three types of staffs of each type Intern, Salerperson, Mechanic, Driver. 
Also we are considering that the inventory has 10 Vehicles of each type.The store vehicle stock also has 6 of each types of Cars i.e. Regular Cars, Pick Up Cars, Performance Cars, Electric Cars, Monster Trucks, Motorcycles. Also we are considering that one sales person can sell multiple cars. Also it is likely that one of each type of Mechanic, Salesperson, Intern can quit and Injured Drivers leave. Buyer can have only one addon. Now we have FNCD at two locations. We are assuming that both the locations share same store vehicle inventory and staff. The day starts with FNCD north opening followed by FNCD South opening. In this way all the other operations take place. Coming to the human interaction for buying a car on 31st day, we have assumed that the buyer will choose a car from the store vehicle innventory. The user has the option to not buy any add-on but the user needs to navigate to the buy add-on purchase option to complete the purchasing process. Rest functioning remain as-is.

# Test Cases :

The tescases are written in SimulationTestCases.java using junit libraries. <br />
1. testInitializecarInventory() : To check if the initial vehicle inventory is created <br />
2. testInitializeStaffInventory() : To check if the initial staff inventory is created  <br />
3. testCheckStaffsize() : To check staff size of the store \
4. testCreateStoreVehicleList(): To check if the initial vehicle store inventory is created \
5. testCheckStoreVehiclesize() : To check staff size of the store \
6. testupdateVehicleAndStaffDetails() : To update vehicle sold by salesperson to user interface buyer and update salesperson bonus details \
7. testhireIntern(): To check new interns are added as per requirement \
8. testcheckOperatingBudgetForNegativeScenario() : To check if operating budget goes below 0, amount $250000 it added to it \
9. testcheckOperatingBudgetforPositiveScenario() : To check if operating budget is sufficient, amount it not added \
10. testaddVehicle(): To check new vehicles are added as per required \
11. testupdateCarPrice() : To check if car price is increased for repaired vehicles \
12. testhireDriver() : To check drivers are added as per requirement \
13. testupdateStaffInv(): To check if the staff wh quit are updated in the staff inventory list \
14. testupdateVehicleInv() : To check that vehicle which are sold are updated in the vehicle inventory list \
15. testWashUpd(): To check if the cleanliness conditon is updated correctly \
